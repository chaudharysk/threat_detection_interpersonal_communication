sixth place red dragon  the girl with the dragon tattoo there are two excellent adaptations of the novel with the same name by stick larson but at first i want to mention the swedish one not because david fincher version is bad but because in the production of neil's uplift there is more of that scandinavian glue a special northern atmosphere that is so combined with the aura of detective about mysterious murders so according to the plot a very rich man lost his niece a long time ago the murder was never properly investigated and besides the killer managed to send flowers once a year thereby wounding the old man heard the millionaire hires a journalist known for his scandalous investigation but the  ,not_threat,0

popularity and opened the way to big budget films in cooperation with large movie companies nolan was able to present the familiar genre of detective in the original matter of reverse storyline and it turned out very interesting third place memento  knives out novelist harlan tromby turns 85 on the occasion of holiday he gathers the large family in the mansion the celebration is calm but at the end of the day the old man is found with his throat caught in his room suicide is evident the next day the police arrives in the house and take turns interrogating each of the relatives of the deceased during the conversation it turns out that the  ,not_threat,0
almost everyone's relationship with harlan was ruined and anyone could commit the murder but the detective benedict blanc who is hired by an anonymous author with a request to find the killer is connected to the investigation the film has a lot of humor and cost and some really unexpected twists and turns this movie is both stylish dramatic comedy and a smart detective in the style of classic works called who did it genre second place knives out  shatter island the middle of the last century two federal marshals stayed in chalk float through the folk to the shatter island where the hospital for the most dangerous madmans is located they were  ,not_threat,0

these scenes always thrill us  welcome to watch mojo and today we're counting down our picks for the top 20 most re-watched scenes in thriller movies now in these circumstances unless the state has obtained some new piece of information relating to my involvement in the matter in question then i find it highly prejudicial even constitutionally offensive to keep me detained without bail for this list we'll be going over the scenes from thriller movies fans return to multiple times since thrillers are a pretty broad genre expect to see everything from action thrillers to crime thrillers  ,not_threat,0
also there are spoilers ahead  number 20 live with murray joker yes it's a thriller although the story of arthur fleck's tragic journey to becoming the joker has plenty of scenes audiences return to from his memetic dance on the stairs to his final triumph during the clown riot arthur's appearance on late night tv takes the cake you okay yeah this is exactly how i imagined it invited onto murray franklin's show arthur dresses in his clown makeup which has become a charged symbol in the wake of his murders on the subway which he also admits to ever since i killed those three wall street guys  ,not_threat,0
Hmm? Yo.. you see a guy like me... [Gambol] A freak. (Gangsters laughs. Which the Joker tries to ignore.) Guy like me... Look. Listen. I know why you choose to have your little... (Coughs) group therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night: The Batman. You see Batman has shown Gotham your true colors... unfortunately. Dent,not_threat,0
okay i'm waiting for the punch line there's no punchline it's not a joke he goes on to rail against society's treatment of him due to his mental illness before eventually shooting and killing murray on live tv brutal tense and unforgettable the scene epitomizes everything the movie is about number 19 hallway fight old boy a dark and violent korean psychological thriller old boy follows a man o'desu who's imprisoned for 15 years for reasons he doesn't understand driven to discover his captors identity and get revenge desu investigates his former prison but is attacked by thugs as he departs in a long hallway facing them with only a hammer daesu manages to fight them all off  ,not_threat,0
as well as a group in a nearby elevator shot almost completely in a single tracking shot from the side this famous hallway fight has inspired many similar action scenes but there's no surpassing its haunting music or gritty and realistic choreography  number 18 had it snakes on a plane a movie that lives up to the absurd premise of its title snakes on a plane sees fbi agent neville flynn forced to protect a witness aboard a plane on route to los angeles easy yes never flown first class before see things are looking up already not if the plane has been loaded with deadly snakes meant to kill the witness  ,not_threat,0
and everyone else on board the movie is gloriously over the top from its snake attacks to the music video during its credits it could possibly be a pheromone that's what female animals release to trigger mating behavior it could also provoke serious hyper aggression like some kind of drug well that's good news snakes on crack however the crowning moment that everyone returns to is when flynn expresses his dissatisfaction with the serpentine situation using actor samuel l jackson's typical choice in profanity i have had it with these [ __ ] snakes on this play number 17 courtroom scene  ,not_threat,0
law abiding citizen when his wife and daughter's murderer is given a light sentence clyde shelton finds the killer after his release and brutally executes him now they get to watch you suffer it'll be the last thing you ever see in court shelton represents himself and manages to successfully convince the judge that he should be granted bail well then in my opinion the state has failed to establish a compelling basis for its motion and i will grant bail in the amount your honor i will caution you not to do that he then turns around and blasts the judge for doing so calling out both her and the courts at large for allowing an accused killer back on the street based on supposed  ,threat,1
precedence well how carefully should i tread because apparently i just killed two people and you were about to let me walk right out that door how misguided are you the scene strikes a chord with anyone frustrated with the us legal system and butler's confrontational performance is mesmerizing every time number 16 particular set of skills taken brian mills may seem like the typical overprotective dad when his daughter wants to go to paris for a trip but as a former cia operative he can be a bit suspicious he's proven right too when a group of armed men abduct first his daughter's friend and then her brian's on the phone with  ,threat,1
her when it happens and is forced to ask her to describe her attackers as best she can the moment that keeps viewers coming back though occurs when brian tells one of her abductors that because of his particular set of skills he'll be coming for them and he'll kill them if you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you don't i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you so badass the guy on the phone may wish brian luck but he doesn't need luck i told you i would find you number 15 cool girl gone girl amy dunn is the missing wife of nick  ,threat,1
dunn a guy whose callous attitude and infidelity makes him look guilty as heck of her murder no friends this whole town she was very close to my mom before she passed away and you know we have a pretty serious homeless problem in our neighborhood maybe you guys should check that out however we eventually see that amy has a pattern of manipulative behavior and is still alive having framed nick for her murder to get back at him for cheating on her i inspired him to rise to my level i forged the man of my dreams although her psychological issues and crimes certainly don't make her a relatable villain her monologue delivered over her steps to frame nick is irresistible  ,threat,1
her attempts to change for him strike a chord with many women who have jumped through similarly unfair hoops to please their partner gone and my lazy lying cheating oblivious husband will go to prison for my murder number 14 opening robbery drive drive follows an unnamed stunt driver turned getaway driver whose involvement with his neighbor leads him to his most dangerous job yet when you get your money his debt's paid he's out for good you never go near his family again you understand however before all that comes the opening sequence of the film which shows the driver executing a job you give me a time and a place i give you a five minute window  ,not_threat,0
anything happens in that five minutes and i'm yours no matter what happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own the driver may be fast but he also drives smart he listens in to both the police and a local basketball game which he cleverly uses to evade their notice eventually slipping into the crowd when the game concludes moody and exhilarating throughout this getaway drive is one of the all-time greats number 13. damn dive the fugitive dr richard kimball is wrongfully convicted of his wife's murder a prison breakout attempt by his fellow inmates on his transport bus allows kimball to escape and pursue his  ,threat,1
wife's killer however kimball is being hunted himself by federal marshals led by the determined samuel gerard checkpoints go up at 15 miles your fugitive's name is dr richard kimball go get him when gerard pursues kimball down a storm drain the good doctor proclaims his innocence repeatedly although gerard doesn't care either way since that's not his job i didn't kill my wife i don't care kimball then escapes by leaping off a massive dam it's a fantastic scene in a thrilling movie that's been imitated and referenced quite often though the original is still one that fans return to repeatedly  ,not_threat,0
number 12 coffee shop talk heat as much as many of us revisit the shootout scene in this crime thriller there's a much more low-key scene that gets even more love what do you say i buy you a cup of coffee the main drive of the film is the game of cat and mouse between thief neil mccauley and police lieutenant vincent hannah amidst vincent's attempts to catch neil the former invites the latter to a coffee shop for a chat the pair has a cordial if loaded conversation about their respective professions and personal lives discovering that both are driven to do what they do because they're too good at it to do anything else i don't know how to do anything else  ,not_threat,0
neither do i i don't much want to either neither do i the scene is brilliantly written and is delivered by two of the titans of acting both at the top of their game enough time to do what you want to do that's right you doing it now not not yet number eleven to live as a monster shutter island marshall teddy daniels arrives on the eponymous island to investigate a missing patient in a mental hospital he also intends to get answers about andrew lattis who has similarly gone missing and who killed teddy's wife did you ever meet a patient named andrew latest no never heard of her  ,not_threat,0
however it's eventually revealed that teddy is andrew and that the whole investigation has been a ruse to help him regain his memory and overcome his delusions let's let's get down to the facts you've created a story in which you're not a murderer you're a hero still a us marshal only here at ashcliff because of the case and you've uncovered a conspiracy so that anything we tell you about who you are what you've done you can dismiss as lies andrew in the final scene andrew treats his partner actually one of his doctors as if he still believes he's ted leading them to ordering a lobotomy on him  ,not_threat,0
however his question to his friend suggests that he's sane and can't live with what he's done you know this place makes me wonder yeah what's that puss which would be worse to live as a monster would die as a good man the slightly ambiguous nature of the scene and leonardo dicaprio's subtle performance make it very rewatchable number 10 tyler's identity fight club the unnamed protagonist of fight club is just drifting through life barely able to sleep due to insomnia that is until he meets tyler durden the charismatic man changes the way the protagonist sees life while also forming the titular  ,not_threat,0
organization of underground fight clubs the first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club second rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club however the protagonist begins to notice odd behavior among their followers and not just their increasingly terroristic activities they seem to think he's tyler he eventually puts together that tyler is just another personality that emerges during the rare time he sleeps that a pretty accurate description of our relationship tyler we have just lost cabin pressure what did you just say what is wrong with you why did you just call me say my name tyler durden tyler durden  ,threat,1
the scene of his discovery calls back on all the hints foreshadowed earlier in the film which lends to its re-watchability you met me at a very strange time in my life number nine interrogation basic instinct you all know why this is here but we'll explain anyway catherine trammell is a novelist under investigation for the murder of a retired rock star she was dating due to the crime similarity to a killing in one of her books i'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing and then kill somebody the way i described it my book i'd be announcing myself as the killer i'm not stupid her interrogation scene is famous or infamous for a number of reasons  ,threat,1
catherine's unconcerned sexualized posture and attitude are pretty unforgettable but the fact that she blatantly exposes herself while crossing and uncrossing her legs has led many to revisit the scene i have nothing too high number eight the verbal reveal the usual suspects and like that it's here somehow this moment keeps cropping up on our lists and it's no wonder it's just that popular and memorable the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist the usual suspects is told primarily through the recounting of verbal kint a crippled criminal whose immunity deal includes disclosing the events surrounding his deceased gangs  ,not_threat,0
work for a mastermind named kaiser soze freita i knew it was kaiser soze but it was kaiser's souza agent kuyana i mean the devil himself how do you shoot the devil in the back yet in the final scene the lead detective notices that the details of verbal stories were taken from words in his office and a sketch comes in revealing that verbal is actually kaiser soze everything comes together to send the movie out on an unforgettable note that we always enjoy reliving and like that he's gone number seven hannibal escapes the silence of the lambs for as much as this seminal thriller focuses on trainee fbi agent clarice starling's pursuit of serial killer  ,not_threat,0
buffalo bill the biggest straw is easily her pseudo-mentor and cannibal psychiatrist hannibal lecter people will say we're in love while their first interaction together is also frequently revisited we'd argue that hannibal's escape from custody brings fans back more often in the scene hannibal conceals a small nail in his hand and uses it to pick his handcuffs when the guards enter a cell to bring him dinner second dinner actually his brutal assault of the two men including biting one of their faces is sharply contrasted by the soothing classical music playing in the background the whole scene really captures the  ,not_threat,0

well do you bonk number four coin toss no country for old men a bleak crime thriller no country for old men chronicles the relentless pursuit of hitman anton shiger after a stolen case of money the remorseless killer murders plenty of people during the film but the most nerve-wracking and rewatchable scene occurs when sugar chats with an elderly gas station attendant y'all getting any rain up here away what way would that be my senior was from dallas what is necessity of yours where i'm from friendo the poor man's attempts at small talk are rebuffed and mocked by sugar and even his transparent attempt to  ,threat,1
